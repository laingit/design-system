**CHANGES**

The following changes have been made in this release:

- Global Navigation Accessibility Fixes:
  - The app switcher (`slds-icon-waffle_container`) uses a button instead of
    an anchor element.
  - Removed `aria-haspopup=true` from dropdown `li`.
  - Removed `tabindex="0"` from `slds-context-bar__icon-action`.
  - Removed `tabindex="-1"` from `slds-context-bar__icon-action`'s button.
  - Add `aria-haspopup="true"` to `slds-context-bar__icon-action`'s button.
  - Add assistive text to active item for Current page.
- Rounded corners have been removed from utility icons so that they no longer
  clip incorrectly.
- Update focus state for pills
  - Added `slds-pill--link` to modify pill for when we want the hyperlink to take up 100% of the available pill
  - Added `slds-pill__action` to the actionable link element inside of `slds-pill--link`
- Files Component:
  - Updated the actions menu location
  - Added state for no title
  - Added loading state
- Changed spacing between feed items from 1.5rem to .75rem
- The [Button Icon](/components/button-icons/) component is required to have `slds-button--icon` applied to the `<button />` element. Before, `slds-button--icon-inverse`, `slds-button--icon-container`, `slds-button--icon-border`, `slds-button--icon-border-filled`, `slds-button--icon-border-inverse`, `slds-button--icon-more`, and `slds-button--icon-error` were used in conjunction with the `slds-button` classname but we now require `slds-button--icon` to be a part of this grouping of classnames.
- The [Stateful Button](/components/buttons#flavor-stateful) component is required to have `slds-button--stateful` applied to the `<button />` element
- The [Alert](/components/avatar/) component icon is now contained within `slds-icon_container`
- The [Toast](/components/toast/) component icon is now contained within `slds-icon_container`
- The [Page Header](/components/page-headers) component "entity" icon is now contained within `slds-icon_container`
- The [Feeds](/components/feeds/) component "Post" examples have been updated to be contained within the `slds-feed` list
- The [Compound Form Layout](/components/form-layout/#flavor-compound) example was updated so each `fieldset` is correctly using the `slds-form-element` class and the whole form is now contained in `slds-form--compound`
- Unless the HTML output is represented as a list — `ul`, `ol`, or `dl` — all examples were updated to use `slds-bottom--[position]` instead of `slds-has-divider--[position]`

**FIXED**

The following issues have now been resolved:

- Remove `aria-haspopup="true"` from `slds-context-bar__icon-action`'s button
  global nav tab bar.
- Change assistive text on above mentioned button to `New Tab`.
- Added truncation to menu dropdown sub heading - [Dropdown Menu](components/menus/#flavor-dropdown-dropdown-menu-header)
- Fixed a bug where the task2 icon corresponding class name was incorrectly named "task-2"
- Fix for `::-ms-clear` to remove native clear button in IE
- Whenever `slds-truncate` is used, it is required to be used in conjunction with a [title] attribute
- Whenever `slds-dropdown` is used, it is required to be contained inside an element that has the classname `slds-dropdown-trigger`
- Whenever `slds-form--stacked`, `slds-form--horizontal`, and `slds-form--compound` is used, it is required to be used in conjunction with `slds-form`
- Whenever `slds-icon-text-default`, `slds-icon-text-warning`, or `slds-icon-text-error` is used, it is required to be used in conjunction with `slds-icon`
- Scoped :focus style for data-tables to `slds-table`
