/**
 * Faux links are used on areas that can't be wrapped in an `a` element, but need to appear to be a link with an underline on hover. An example is in the page header for Object home. The `H1` and `button` that sit next to each other have the `.slds-text-link--faux` class on their parent element.
 *
 * @summary Creates a faux link with hover interactions
 *
 * @name faux-link
 * @selector .slds-text-link--faux
 * @notes This is used when an actual anchor element can not be used. For example &mdash; when a heading and button are next to each other and both need the text underline
 * @variant
