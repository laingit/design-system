/**
 * #### Accessibility
 *
 * Every `<img>` you add to your site needs to have an `alt` attribute. If the image is informational, set the `alt` equal to a descriptive alternative for that image. If the image is decorative or redundant to adjacent text, set `alt=""`, which conveys to assistive technology users that the image isn’t necessary for understanding the page. Avoid using generic strings like **photo**, **image**, or **icon** as alt values, as they don’t communicate valuable content to the user.
