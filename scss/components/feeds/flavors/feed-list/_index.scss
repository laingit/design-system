/**
 * #### Accessibility
 *
 * Most feeds have a media object containing the user's name and avatar image.
 * If both the image and the name link to the same location, add `tab-index="-1"`
 * to the `<a>` element so that assistive technology does not read out
 * duplicate links.
 *
 * @summary A feed consists of a list of recurring elements of similar types. Examples of a feed would be a discussion feed.
 *
 * @base
 * @name feeds
 * @selector .slds-feed
 * @support dev-ready
 * @category complex
 * @type data-display
