/**
 * A prompt uses the base modal component and then adds the class `.slds-modal--prompt` to the overall `.slds-modal`. The utilities > themes > colors class is placed on the `.slds-modal__head` to create the color of the header. In the example, we illustrate using `.slds-theme--error`. The class `.slds-theme--alert-texture` should be applied to create the striped gradient. The `.slds-modal__footer` receives the class `.slds-theme--default`.
 *
 * #### Accessibility
 *
 * Prompt notifications are similar to modals, in that they are a focus trap, but they should take a slightly different `role` of `alertdialog` to indicate their severity. Like modals they should be labelled by their headings, but additonally they should be desscribed by the message details of the prompt.
 *
 * The element containing the prompt message should be the target focus of the browser when it is displayed, which is why we add `tab-index="0"` to `slds-modal__container`.
 *
 * There is no requirement for a close button, as the confirmation button should be used to dismiss the prompt, along with the usual Esc key dismissal.
 *
 * **Expected markup (same as Modals, but with the following differences):**
 * - Modal has `role="alertdialog"`
 * - Modal has an `aria-describedby` attribute that matches the id of the modal message container.
 * - Modal message container container should have `tab-index="0"`
 *
 * **Expected keyboard interaction (sme as Modal, with the addition of):**
 * - Modal message container should take initial focus
 *
 * @summary Prompt notice grabs the userâ€™s attention & alert them of system-related issues/updates.
 *
 * @base
 * @name prompt
 * @selector .slds-modal--prompt
 * @support dev-ready
 * @category complex
 * @type messaging
 * @role alert
