/**
 * A picklist is a list of actionable items that is invoked by selection of a
 * particular item. That value is then shown as selected and its value is updated
 * within the `.slds-picklist__label`.
 *
 * A multi-select picklist is a list of actionable items that is invoked by
 * selection of a particular item(s). The multi-select picklist can have more
 * than one selected option. When more than one option has been selected, the
 * `.slds-picklist__label` test should update with the total number of selected
 * items, such as "3 options selected". When the picklist loses focus but has
 * items selected, a `.slds-pill_container--bare` should be display below the
 * `.slds-picklist__label` with the selected items in pills, allowing a user to
 * easily remove selected items.
 *
 * The target HTML element and dropdown need to be wrapped in the class
 * `.slds-dropdown-trigger dropdown-trigger--click`.
 *
 * #### Accessibility
 *
 * The main thing that distinguishes menus from other popover blocks is keyboard
 * navigation: elsewhere, users press the Tab key to navigate through actionable
 * items, but in a menu, users press the arrow keys to navigate.
 *
 * **Expected markup:**
 *
 * - Menu trigger is a focusable element (`<a>` or `<button>`) with `aria-haspopup="true"`
 * - Menu has `role="menu"` and an `aria-labelledby` attribute whose value is the id of the menu trigger
 * - Menu items have `role="menuitem"`, `role="menuitemcheckbox"`, or `role="menuitemradio"`
 *
 * **Expected keyboard interactions:**
 *
 * - Arrow keys cycle focus through menu items (you should use JS to disable focus for any disabled items)
 * - Tab key closes menu and moves focus to the next focusable element on the page
 * - Esc key closes menu and moves focus back to the menu trigger
 * - Any character key moves focus to the next menu item that starts with that character, if applicable
 *
 * @summary Picklists, commonly known as dropdown menus, allow the user to select one option or multiple options from a list. Picklists are used instead of radio lists and checkbox lists inside of a larger form. They provide more flexibility in the number of options the user can choose from.
