## About Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs are typically constructed with an `ol` because their order matters. You mark up breadcrumbs with classes from the horizontal list utility. When you add the `.slds-breadcrumb` class, the separators are automatically generated.

### Accessibility

Place the breadcrumb in a <code className="doc">nav</code> element with <code className="doc">role="navigation"</code>. The <code className="doc">nav</code> element is also marked-up with <code className="doc">aria-label="Breadcrumbs"</code> to describe the type of navigation.

## Base

<CodeView>
  {Breadcrumbs.default}
</CodeView>

## Variations

### With Overflow

The overflow menu breadcrumbs variant is a composition of the overflow menu with actions example of the menus component and breadcrumbs component. To implement this, include the overflow menu as the first `<li>` in the breadcrumb component. In order to vertically align all of the breadcrumb items to the center, add the `.slds-grid_vertical-align-center` class to the `<ol>`.

<CodeView style={{height: '150px'}}>
