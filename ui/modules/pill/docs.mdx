## About Pills

The Pill component is composed of a span with class `lwc-pill` containing text wrapped in a span wtih class `lwc-pill__label`. 

To make a Pill dismissible, a Button Icon is included to the right-hand side of `slds-pill__label`, or, in the case of a clickable Pill, to the right of `lwc-pill__action` (see the Linked Text example below). The span containing the Button Icon should have the class `lwc-pill__remove` and the Button Icon should use the "X" icon.

### Accessibility

<Blockquote type="a11y" header="Accessibility Note">
  Clickable events should only be placed on elements that are inherently clickable. For Pills, this means on linked text and/or the dismiss button only. The Pill as a whole should not have a click event.
</Blockquote>

## Default

<CodeView>
  {PillExamples.default}
</CodeView>

## States

When an error occurs in an interaction with a Pill, the containing span (`lwc-pill`) gains the addditional class `lwc-pill_has-error`.

<CodeView>
  {getDisplayElementById(PillExamples.states, 'pill-error')}
</CodeView>

## Examples

### Linked Text

To make a Pill clickable, `lwc-pill__label` may be contained inside a link with class `lwc-pill__action`. 

The link should also have the title attribute matching the label text in case the text gets truncated.

<CodeView>
  {getDisplayElementById(PillExamples.examples, 'pill-link')}
</CodeView>

### With Icon

Additionally, a pill may have an Icon or Avatar that sits to the left-hand side of the `lwc-pill__label`, or, in the case of a clickable Pill, to the left of `lwc-pill__action`. The span containing the media object (Icon or Avatar) should have the class `lwc-pill__media`.

<CodeView>
  {getDisplayElementById(PillExamples.examples, 'pill-icon')}
</CodeView>

### With Icon and Linked Text

To make a Pill clickable, `lwc-pill__label` may be contained inside a link with class `lwc-pill__action`. Icons and Avatars sit next to the link and not inside it. 

The link should also have the title attribute matching the label text in case the text gets truncated.

<CodeView>
  {getDisplayElementById(PillExamples.examples, 'pill-icon-link')}
</CodeView>

### With Truncated Text

Truncation is built into the Pill component. The maximum width is set by the parent containing the Pill.

<CodeView>
  {getDisplayElementById(PillExamples.examples, 'pill-truncated')}
</CodeView>
