## About Tabset

The default tab set style encapsulates everything that is underneath it without enclosing it visually. Because tab sets can be nested, pay close attention to the markup. They are constructed to prevent styles from leaking from parent tab sets into child tab sets.

## Implementation

### Custom Elements

Tabset is constructed with three custom elements:

- `lightning-tabset`
- `lightning-tab-bar`
- `lightning-tab`

#### &lt;lightning-tabset&gt;

### CSS Variables

Tabset has an exposed set of CSS variables, for the optional purpose of customization.

- --lwc-c-tabset-color-border (\$color-gray-7)
- --lwc-c-tabset-color-tab (\$color-gray-12)
- --lwc-c-tabset-color-active-text (\$brand-accessible)
- --lwc-c-tabset-color (\$brand-primary)
- --lwc-c-tabset-color-active (\$brand-primary-active)

### Accessibility Requirements

The following markup is crucial for Accessibility

- Selected tab’s anchor has `aria-selected="true"`, all other tabs’ anchors have `aria-selected="false"`
- Selected tab’s anchor has `tabindex="0"`, all other tabs have `tabindex="-1"`
- Each tab’s anchor has an `aria-controls` attribute whose value is the id of the associated `<div role="tabpanel">`
- Each tab panel has an `aria-labelledby` attribute whose value is the id of its associated `<a role="tab">`

### Keyboard Interactions

- Arrow keys, when focus is on a selected tab, cycle selection to the next or previous tab
- Tab key, when focus is before the tab list, moves focus to the selected tab
- Tab key, when focus is on selected tab, moves focus into the selected tab’s associated tab panel or to the next focusable element on the page if that panel has no focusable elements
- Shift+Tab keys, when focus is on first element in a tab panel, moves focus back to the selected tab

### JavaScript Needs

### Accessibility [TODO: merge with above or rewrite]

Tabbed UIs have three parts with specific ARIA role requirements:

- The tab list, which should have `role="tablist"`
- The tabs in that list, which should each be an `<a role="tab">` anchor wrapped in a `<li role="presentation">` list item
- The tab panels, which display each tab’s content and should each have `role="tabpanel"`

## Variants and Examples

### Base

<Example title="Tabs Base">
  <CodeView style={{ height: '200px' }}>{TabsetExamples.default}</CodeView>
</Example>

#### With Overflow

The overflow tab style is provided as a tab item type that acts as a menu component and appears as a tab item. It could contain those tab items that don't all fit in a horizontal orientation.

[todo: waiting on menu]

#### With Icon

Icons can be used with tabs to help users differentiate among them.

<Example title="Tabs With Icons">
  <CodeView style={{ height: '200px' }}>
    {getDisplayElementById(TabsetExamples.examples, 'with-start-icon')}
  </CodeView>
</Example>

#### With End Icon

Alternatively, you can use the end icon to display an icon after the tab's label. This can be used, for example, to communicate when a tab contains a validation error that needs attention.

<Example title="Tab With End Icon">
  <CodeView style={{ height: '200px' }}>
    {getDisplayElementById(TabsetExamples.examples, 'with-end-icon')}
  </CodeView>
</Example>
